Here's a README tailored for the frontend folder (`web-app`) of your project:

---

# @repo/web-app

The frontend application for the **Typescript-Python-Fullstack** monorepo, built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. This project is a part of a full-stack architecture, providing the user interface for interacting with the backend.

## Features
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)** with **Next.js**.
- Written in **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience.
- Integrated with a Python backend (via APIs).
- Modular and reusable UI components.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js**: React framework with SSR/SSG capabilities.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript.
- **TailwindCSS** (optional): For rapid UI styling.

## Installation
1. Navigate to the `web-app` folder:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or yarn install
   ```

## Development
To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

## Build for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
This will generate the static files in the `.next` folder, which can be deployed.

## Linting and Formatting
To ensure code quality and consistency, run the following commands:

- **Linting**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

- **Prettier** (for code formatting):
   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```


## Environment Variables
This app may require environment variables to connect with the backend or third-party services. Add these variables in a `.env.local` file.

Example:
```
API_BASE_URL=your base url to python server.
```
